**Clipal** is the local LLM API proxy built for developer productivity. If you use AI coding tools like Claude Code, Continue, Aider, or Cherry Studio, Clipal acts as your intelligent traffic controller. It consolidates multiple model providers, handles automatic failover, manages API keys, and offers a beautiful Web UI—so you can focus on coding, not configuring.

## ✨ Why Clipal?

### 🚀 **One-Click CLI Takeover**
No more hunting for hidden config files. With a single click in the Web UI, Clipal can automatically take over the configurations for **Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Continue, Aider**, and **Goose**. 
- It configures the local base URL for you.
- It backs up your original settings.
- It provides a safe rollback whenever you want.

### 🛡️ **Bulletproof Failover & Multi-Key Rotation**
Tired of hitting rate limits or empty balances mid-generation?
- **Multi-Key Pool**: Configure multiple `.api_keys` for a single provider. Clipal rotates them automatically and retries locally before giving up.
- **Priority Failover**: Fall back to secondary models or providers instantly with out-of-the-box circuit breaking and quota management.

### 🎛️ **Beautiful Local Web UI**
Manage your AI workflows visually. Add, edit, enable, or disable providers, pin a specific model, and manage global settings with a modern dashboard. All changes are hot-reloaded—no restarts required.

### ⚡ **Frictionless Background Service**
Clipal runs as a single, cross-platform binary on macOS, Linux, and Windows. 
Type `clipal service install` and `clipal service start` to keep it running silently in the background forever. Use `clipal status` or `clipal restart` for quick management.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Let Your AI Install It

If you use a terminal-capable AI such as Claude Code or Codex CLI, you can send it the prompt below:

```text
Please help me install and start Clipal. Project: https://github.com/lansespirit/Clipal

Please detect my current OS and architecture, check the project's Releases and docs, and complete the download, installation, and startup for me. Then confirm that I can open the Web UI successfully. Use these official links when needed:
- Releases: https://github.com/lansespirit/Clipal/releases
- Getting Started: https://github.com/lansespirit/Clipal/blob/main/docs/en/getting-started.md
- Web UI: https://github.com/lansespirit/Clipal/blob/main/docs/en/web-ui.md

After that, guide me through using the Web UI to enable CLI takeover and add my first provider.
```

### 1. Install Clipal
Download the standalone binary for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/lansespirit/Clipal/releases) (Current stable release: [`v0.11.4`](https://github.com/lansespirit/Clipal/releases/tag/v0.11.4)) and put it on your `PATH`.
```bash
chmod +x clipal*
./clipal* --version
```

### 2. Initialize Configurations
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.clipal
cp examples/config.yaml ~/.clipal/config.yaml
cp examples/claude.yaml ~/.clipal/claude.yaml
cp examples/openai.yaml ~/.clipal/openai.yaml
cp examples/gemini.yaml ~/.clipal/gemini.yaml
```
*Edit the generated `~/.clipal/*.yaml` files to add your API keys.*

### 3. Run & Manage
Start Clipal in the foreground:
```bash
clipal
```
Or install it as a background service:
```bash
clipal service install
clipal service start
```

### 4. Open the Web UI
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:3333/` in your browser to manage providers and apply **CLI Takeover** for your favorite tools.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- Clipal is fully local. The proxy listens on `127.0.0.1:3333` by default.
- The Web UI is strictly locked to localhost—even if the proxy listens externally, the management UI rejects non-loopback requests.
- Your upstream API keys are stored only on your machine and transparently injected into requests.
